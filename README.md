# Tokenization
This project is focused on exploring and evaluating various tokenization strategies for malware data. The primary objective is to determine the most effective tokenization technique for training superior NLP models. We will experiment with different n-grams derived from opcodes in malware files, which represent the fundamental units of operation in the malwareâ€™s code.

Once the tokenization process is complete, we will generate embeddings - numerical representations of the tokens that capture their contextual meanings. These embeddings will serve as the input for our NLP models.

The efficacy of the chosen tokenization technique will be assessed by applying classification tasks using the trained models. The performance of these models in accurately classifying malware will provide insights into the effectiveness of the tokenization strategy.

This project stands at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Cybersecurity, aiming to enhance malware detection capabilities by leveraging advanced NLP techniques. It represents a novel approach to understanding and interpreting the language of malware.
